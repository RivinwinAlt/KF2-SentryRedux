# KF2-SentryMod-Remake
Overview: A rework of  Commander Comrade Slav's TF2 Sentry mod on the Steam Workshop.

Details: as of now we have pirated Slav's intillectual property in an effort to continue his work for the enjoyment of all Modded-KF2 players. This repository will be kept private for the safety and reputation of those who work on it until all code and models have been completely replaced from the ground up or the original author gives his blessing to the project.

File Structure: Decompiled code will be kept seperate from the compileable classses and unchanged. All changes to code should occur in the "SentryRemake" folder. This folder is named such that it can be easily moved/added to KFEditor.ini

Comment Guidelines: Comment all committed code changes. If you touch it, comment it for others to read.
