# KF2-SentryMod-Remake
Overview: A rework of  Commander Comrade Slav's TF2 Sentry mod on the Steam Workshop.

Details: As of now we have pirated Slav's intellectual property in an effort to continue his work for the enjoyment of all Modded-KF2 players. This repository will be kept private for the safety and reputation of those who work on it until all code and models have been completely replaced from the ground up or the original author gives his blessing to the project.

File Structure: Decompiled code will be kept seperate from the compileable classses and unchanged. All changes to code should occur in the "Classes" folder.

Comment Guidelines: Comment all committed code changes. If you touch it, comment it for others to read.

Project Goals:
	- Expose most constant variables in config files.
	- Ensure the mod is as lightweight as possible for servers without sacrificing functionality.
	- Integrate perks that boost or alter turrets.
	- Integrate more buyable upgrades.
	- Fix longstanding bugs.
