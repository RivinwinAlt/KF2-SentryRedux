# TF2 Sentry Redux

### Overview:
A rework/update of Marco's TF2 Sentry mod from the Steam Workshop, currently uploaded by Commander Comrade Slav.


### Details:
As of now we have pirated Marco's intellectual property in an effort to continue his work for the enjoyment of all Modded-KF2 players. We have recieved permission from Commander Comrade Slav to duplicate his workshop listing and have obtained his source materials. We have also recieved permission from Forrest Mark X to use menu code from his Classic Mode mod to create the turret upgrade menu. The mod will be published openly and free of charge with no favoritism towards any group or member of the KF2 community over another. The mod will not contain any info or advertising concerning contributors beyond their preffered handle and contribution.


### GitHub File Structure:
Decompiled code will be kept seperate from the working classses and unchanged. All changes to code should occur in the "Classes" folder.


### Workshop Upload Structure
Workshop listings are currently maintained by Rivinwin, there is an alpha build listing and a beta build listing.
| Build | Workshop ID | Notes |
| ---: | :---: | :--- |
| Alpha | 2825354864 | Usually broken, maintained by Rivinwin |
| Beta | 2815922523 | Usually buggy, maintained by Rowdy |
| Public Beta | | No release date |
| Release | | No release date |

N.B. - The package and script names are identical between listings so you must delete the server and/or client download caches when switching between them.


### Commenting Code Guidelines:
Try to comment all blocks of code that include complex math or use variables with unclear names. This will allow multiple people through the years to repair the codebase as well as promote cooperation between team members.


### Project Goals:
- Fix long-standing bugs
- Implement new and exciting features
- Make most variables configurable by the player
- Recieve permission from all previously involved modders
- Create a new TF2 themed Upgrade UI using Classic Mode code
- Optimize server computation
- Optimize replication bandwidth
- Optimize asset package size
- Refactor code for future expansion and upkeep
